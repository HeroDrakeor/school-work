This whole repo is just for school work, ignore if you want, don't if you don't.

Testing-thing.py is a random number generator that randomly generates a number between 0 and 100,003,840. It then puts that number into a CSV file known as "testing-thing.csv". It's next function is to find out if the number generated is prime. It has a few messages for larger numbers, and smaller numbers also have a special status, though I'm not entirely sure if it can roll or not.
